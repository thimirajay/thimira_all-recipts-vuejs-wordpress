This is a example app for loading data from any api using VueJs. This will help you to build your own custom template using VueJs and change data dynamically in a single web page.

I only used one html file and one js file for this example. It will help anyone to add this code for anyones project.

This code can be use for any kind of project that using html and javascript. I have build this in a wordpress site. But i am uploading only this two file because of it is easy to understand anyone. You can see the final output from the below SS.

Above SS shows the index.html file. it just a simple html file. in the body  i have created "div" tag with a id named "app" and inside of it there is a "component" tag to load all the dynamic data using VueJs. I only used 3 Scripts with CDN links for the development."app.js" is a custom js file that i have used to write VueJs.

# Q&A

## 1. How did you test that your implementation was correct?

  First of all i followed the instructions that given to me in the assignment , after that i compared the fron end design and functionality with the given    example project. and i finished the requirement with only one html file and one js file. so i am sure my implementation is correct.

## 2. If this was destined for a production environment, what would you add or change?

  Here is some of my ideas
  
  * I will add a search option for this
  * We can convert loading images to Base64 for speed up the initial loading

## 3. What compromises did you have to make as a result of the time constraints of this challenge?

  Actually this is the first time i am using VueJs. i am good with the laravel framework and VueJs is my targeted language to study. But normally i we need to studdy a new programming language a least i takes 1 week. The thing is i got only 3 working days to finish this requirement , and it was a mind blowing challenge to me. But i accepted it with my maximum capacity and i full fill the requirements.
